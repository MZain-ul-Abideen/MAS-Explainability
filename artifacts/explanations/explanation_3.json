  "query": "Give me an overview of the system",
  "answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here is an overview of the system:\n\nThe system consists of 20 agents, 10 norms, and 7 missions. The compliance summary shows that 6 norms were fulfilled, 1 was violated, and 193 were not applicable.\n\nThe agents in the system have various roles, including suppliers (supplier1 and supplier2), workstations (wa_trunks1, wa_rails1, els), and others (Moise, wa_trunks1, inspector, RTS, AuctionSkateArt, WorkstationArt). The top actions of each agent suggest that they are involved in tasks such as supplying parts, assembling components, and managing auctions.\n\nThe norms in the system define obligations for different roles, including assembly agents, customers, suppliers, and workstations. The compliance results show that some agents (supplier1 and supplier2) have fulfilled their obligations, while others (els) have violated theirs.\n\nThe missions in the system define tasks such as managing assembly, sending orders, contracting parts, and assembling parts. The fulfillment status of each mission shows that some have been fulfilled (manage_assembly, send_order, contract_parts, allocate_workstations, deliver_parts), while others have been violated (assemble_parts) or have no assigned agents (perform_quality_control).\n\nWhat is missing from the evidence is a clear understanding of the relationships between the agents, norms, and missions. Additionally, the roles of some agents (e.g., Moise, wa_trunks1, inspector, RTS, AuctionSkateArt, WorkstationArt) are unknown, which makes it difficult to fully understand their actions and compliance with norms. Furthermore, the evidence does not provide a timeline of events or a clear overview of the system's overall objective.",
