  "query": "Which norms were violated and why?",
  "answer": "According to the evidence, Norm n7 was violated by Agent els. The reason for the violation is that no actions were found that fulfilled the obligation 'assemble_parts' (Compliance Results). This is also consistent with Agent els' top action being \"ignoring\" (Agent Profile), which suggests that the agent did not take the required action.\n\nThe evidence does not provide information on why Agent els chose to ignore the obligation, only that the norm was violated due to the lack of fulfilling actions.",
