  "query": "Did all suppliers fulfill their obligations?",
  "answer": "According to the evidence, both suppliers (supplier1 and supplier2) have fulfilled their obligations as stated in norm n5, which is to deliver parts. The compliance results for both suppliers show that they have fulfilled this obligation, with evidence counts of 2 each. \n\nSpecifically, the compliance results for supplier1 and supplier2 reference log entries (e.g., entry_26 and entry_27 for \"Ready to supply parts\") as supporting evidence for fulfilling their obligations. \n\nHowever, the evidence does not provide detailed information about the specific parts delivered, the quantity, or the timeline of delivery. It only confirms that both suppliers have fulfilled their obligations to deliver parts, as per norm n5. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that both suppliers have fulfilled their obligations, but the details of these deliveries are not fully specified in the given evidence.",
